# Bignumber library and RSA Implementation

The goal is to implement a big number library in C, and to implement the RSA algorithm on top of it.

Functions implemented:

```
1. String to bignumber
2. Addition
3. Subtraction
4. Multiplication
5. Remainder
6. Modular addition
7. Modular multiplication
8. Modular exponentiation
9. Fermat test
10.Generate a random number
11.Generate a random prime number
```

RSA Implementation:

RSA implementation has been done With the functions mentioned above (big number library)

```
  1. KeyGeneration
  2. RSA Encryption
  3. RSA Decryption
  4. RSA Testing
```
